# PF-Terminal
Linux terminal emulator made in Java.

This project started with the idea of taking crontrol of the system if you're locked out, and the only way to enter is using Java.

That's why the project is compiled in Java 8.

## Requirements ##
- Java 8+
- Linux OS

## Building from source ##
```shell
$ make build
$ java -jar PF-Terminal.jar
```

## To do ##
- Complete package build
- Receive every information of the actual terminal
- Port to other systems
- Multi-terminal screens.
- Link OpenJDK java to the actual repository.
- No need to use Maven. Don't need for the moment and I expect it won't.
